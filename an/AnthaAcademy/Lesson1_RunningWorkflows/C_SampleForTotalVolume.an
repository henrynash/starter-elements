// The core process for this protocol, with the steps to be performed
// for every input
Steps {
	
	// make empty slice of LHComponents (i.e. of length 0) ready to sequentially add all samples to
	// See golangbook chapter 6 for more details on slices and arrays
	allsamples := make([]*wtype.LHComponent,0)
	
	// SampleForTotalVolume will "top up" solution to the TotalVolume with Diluent.
	// In this case it will still add diluent first but calculates the volume to add by substracting the volumes of subsequent components
	diluentsample := mixer.SampleForTotalVolume(Diluent,TotalVolume) // i.e. if TotalVolume == 20ul and SolutionVolume == 2ul then 18ul of Diluent will be sampled here
	
	// append will add the diluent sample to the allsamples slice
	allsamples = append(allsamples,diluentsample)
	
	solutionsample := mixer.Sample(Solution,SolutionVolume)
	
	allsamples = append(allsamples,solutionsample)
	
	// The Sample functions will not generate liquid handling instructions on their own
	// We need to tell Antha what to do with samples
	// For this we need to use one of the Mix functions
	// therefore finally we use Mix to combine samples into a new component
	DilutedSample = Mix(allsamples...)
	
	// Now we have an antha element which will generate liquid handling instructions
	// let's see how to actually run the protocol
	// open the terminal and 
	// work your way through the lessons there showing how to specify parameters and different types of workflow

// Run after controls and a steps block are completed to
// post process any data and provide downstream results
